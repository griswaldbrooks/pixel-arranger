# Save and Load State

`pixel-arranger` offers a save and load feature that enables users to save their application state, including the images on the canvas and the window dimensions, and load it later. This functionality is useful for users who want to continue working on their image collection from where they left off. When closing the application, the state is saved to a JSON file. Upon starting the application, the state is loaded from the JSON file, allowing users to resume their work seamlessly.
